I used to not believe in capturing and sharing any personal moment, either to show to friends or post on social networks. I don't actually remember when but I have rapidly changed my mindset on sharing and social networking in a more open way. This page in this blog, as part of my social network existence, mainly serves as a place where I would like to share my Nonprofessional-photography work. To share some of my views of our world with visitors; cheers.

I feel I had chosen great angles when taking those two photos.<br/>

The greatness of this one is that this photo captures an aircraft rising with white track left behind in sky, together with human on the trail at the bottom, which could create a peaceful feeling.<br/>
