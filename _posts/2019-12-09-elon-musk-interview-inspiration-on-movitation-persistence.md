I found this video from my facebook feeds list today, and the quote I took from the video still make me feel inspired. For those who are ambitious with a lot of big goals, when you are in your down times, think about that one reason why wanted to start.


```
"When you are about to give up, think about that one reason why you wanted to start"
```
