Together with another David within ThoughtSpot and Ashish, I took a one day trip to Northstar Ski Resort at Tahoe, CA on Jan 20, 2018. I had a good time enjoying the good snow that just arrived at Tahoe lately, and would like to share my day trip here.  
  
  
As we need to carpool to Tahoe, we need to meetup first in the Bay area. Taking the fact that one way to Tahoe will consume around 4 hours, we need to get up around 5 am in the morning to make the most of the time for skiing/snowboarding. I have taken a few photos along the way to Tahoe to give you a sense of show how driving for a trip like this would look like:

Two points to raise here:  
* Getting up early and driving for 4 hours is extremely exhausting.
  1. However, it helps you avoid heavy traffic. For snow days like today, local ski resorts will anticipate a heavy amonut skiers and that is equally heavy amount of traffic. For example, as today, we heard from another friend(Maxim) that he ran into 4 miles of traffic jam when we already arrived. 
  2. Consider Ski buses if you are going by yourself. There are now a few ski buses going to Tahoe and bringing up back at the end of the day for around $50. It is, I think, a pretty good deal to save your energy from tiring driving at the cost worth around two round trips of gasoline.
  3. So if you really wanna reduce the cost of transportation, ask your buddies to carpool with you and rotate to drive for going and coming back.  
* Don't forget to stop and take photos.
  1. For those who don's get mountains once in a while, and especially on a sunny after heavy snow's arrival in the area, remember to stop for a few photos, you will be amazed by the beauty of snow covered mountains.

Nowadays, when you go to Northstar, you actually park in an outer area outside the village. Then you take a free bus to get to the lift or Gondola to lift onto the hills. After we all geared up, we decided to make a corona toast before getting on the bus:

After we got to the village and finish tickets purchase, It was already close to 11:00am in the morning. In our first lift riding, we took a selfie with the help from David S.

In addition, I photoed a view on our first lift up of seats in front of us:
