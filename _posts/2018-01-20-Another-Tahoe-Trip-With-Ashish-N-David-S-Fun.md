Together with David S. and Ashish, I took an one day trip to Northstar Ski Resort at Tahoe, CA on Jan 20, 2018. I had a good time enjoying the good snow that just arrived at Tahoe lately, and would like to share my day trip in this post.  
   
As we agreed to carpool to Tahoe, we needed to meetup first in the Bay area. Taking the fact into consideration that one way to Tahoe consumes around 4 hours, we then need to get up around 5 am in the morning to make the most of the time for sking/snowboarding. To give you a sense of how driving for a trip like this would look like, I have pasted a few photos I took along the way to Tahoe down below:

After this trip and combining with my previous experiences, I think there are two points worth raising here:  
* First, Getting up early and driving for 4 hours is extremely exhausting.
  1. However, it helps you avoid heavy traffic. For snow days like today, local ski resorts anticipate a heavy amount of skiers and that is equally heavy amount of traffic. For example, as today, we heard from another friend(Maxim, who went to a different ski resort) that he ran into 4 miles of traffic jam right ahead of the his destination. 
  2. Consider Ski buses if you are going by yourself. There are now a few ski buses going to Tahoe and bringing you up back at the end of the day for around $50. It is, I think, a pretty good deal to save your energy from tiring driving for sking/snowboarding at the cost worth around two round trips of gasoline.
  3. Carpool with buddies. If you really wanna reduce the cost of transportation and manage a tiring round trip like this, a great way as we took was to  ask your buddies to carpool with you and rotate to drive for going and coming back.  
* Second, don't forget to stop and take photos.
  1. For those who don's get mountains once in a while, and especially on a sunny day after heavy snow's arrival in the area, remember to stop for a few photos, you will be amazed by the beauty of mountains covered in snow.

Nowadays, when you go to Northstar, you actually need to park in an outer area outside the village. Then you take a free bus to get to the lift or Gondola to lift up to the hills. After we all geared up, we decided to make a corona toast before getting on the bus:

After we got to the village and finish tickets purchase, it was already close to 11:00am in the morning. In our first lift riding, we took a selfie with the help from David S.

In addition, I photoed a view of seats in front of us on our first lift up the hill between the village the upper base.

More on the actual sking part will go into a different post, but at the end of the day, here is some stats of my sking:
