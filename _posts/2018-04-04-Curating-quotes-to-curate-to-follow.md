There are many times when I saw interesting, refreshing or inspiring quotes and the excitement fades out shortly after I saw it and went away - we all have places we need to at. It occurs to me that I might as well curate this list of quotes that I have seen and liked to maybe seize those moments.  

In addition, from time to time at different new days of life, when I look back those quotes, there are always something "new". The "new" things, so to speak, bring up new perspectives and help I re-thnink what is it that I am really interested in and what are those that are truely important in my life.

Quotes are their opinions, choices are all yours.
> NOTE that quotes are more often subjective, and they draw people's emotional reactions. Due to the way people's brain works, you may be tempted to form and shape your ideology accordingly. Avoid that, I would recommend instead thinking more that those quotes themselves (authors background, why they said that, etc), and gradually form your own ideology independently.

> Suggestions of quotes warmly welcome through comments at the bottom of this page.
