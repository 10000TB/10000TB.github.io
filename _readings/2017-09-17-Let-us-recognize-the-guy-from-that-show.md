Jimmy Kimmel - The guy from that show.

Often, we recognize stars and people are familiar with their names. However, there are many actors that appear in many shows, or movies that looks familiar, but people don’t know their names. This show on Jimmy Kimmel presents the award for the guy from that show to recognize those kinds of people.

For the first guys, I can’t recall him from any show I have seen. However, he looked a little familiar to me. I will give it a 25% if there has to be a measure. In addition, he looks like someone from 007 movie series. 

The second guys does not look familiar at all to me. So, nothing to say.

The third guy. Wait, what did the third guy look like? Anyway, skip a description of him here as I already forget his look.

The fourth guy is from a Netfilix show: Silicon Valley, which is down-to-earth and interesting to watch. I have been watching it since the beginning season. The guy in the show is first a hired CEO for the start up: Pied Piper. He then moved on to other roles in the show and he has been appeared in since the season 2 (I guess, need to double check). 

Jimmy Kimmel then announced that the fourth guys got the award for the guy from that show. It was finally a moment for the fourth guys to reveal his name to the audience. Unfortunately, he got dragged off the stage when he was about to do that. It then remains to be unknown what his name is. 

In summary, it was a fun clip to show people that in shows that we have been watching day to day, there are many actors that have made those shows great and fun to watch but few of them got recognized and their names are not usually known to people. We, as audience, show not take their great work for granted, and thumbs up to them for their work and appearances in all those shows.
