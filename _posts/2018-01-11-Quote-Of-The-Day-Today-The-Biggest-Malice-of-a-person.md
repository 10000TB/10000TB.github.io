I was reading an article this morning, and this quote came to my attention:<br/>
<br/>

> 一个人最大的恶意，就是把自己的理解强加于别人，把所有的结果理所当然的地用自己的过程来解释，并一直坚持自己是正确的。

My translation of into english is:<br/>
<br/>

> The biggest malice of a person is: imposing his/her own view on other people, taking it for granted that all results should be explained from his/her perspective, and tirelessly insisting on he/she is right.

I wouldn't write further, but leave the thinking freedom to all of you readers. <br/>
