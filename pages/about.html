‣ Email is the best way to reach me.<br/>
‣ In general, I try to reply to as many emails as I can as long as it is from real people and for good cause.<br/>
‣ A short message will be helpful. A message that more than 30 seconds to read is likely to be disregarded.<br/>
‣ A reply is not guaranteed - solicitations within following areas are more likely to be replied.<br/>
‣ Areas: 0) information security complaint. 1) connect for general discussion around tech. 2) entrepreneurship. 3) we know each other before, reconnect now. 4) ski. <br/>
‣ What will be ignored: automated emails, 3rd party recruiter solicitations.

<span style="width:80px;height:30px;background-color:rgba(0,49,107,0.6);color:white;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some facts about me:&nbsp;&nbsp;</Strong></span><br/>
‣ I received my bachelor of science degree(computer science) from <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a> Dec 2016. Go Rams.<br/>
‣ I jumped from 110th floor of a building once.<br/>
‣ In case you find it hard to pronounce my chinese name (SHOO-how HOO), I go by David. <br/>
‣ The most frequent edittor command I use on a daily basis is `:w` in vim - I find it annoying, and hope there is an auto-save soon. <br>
‣ I once drove up south lake Tahoe, CA with a 2 wheel drive coupe, and got stuck in heavy snow for ~ 6 hours, and survived back to bay area luckily. <br/>

‣ "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened" <br/>

‣ "Practicing empathy changes the way we see the world"
