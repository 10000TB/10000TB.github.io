I came across an article of a candidate's experience with interviewing with Google. The impression I got from his words is that he's got great experience and he will still feel happy and lucky to have interviewed with google even he got rejected eventually.

His experience sheds light on the general positive recruiting experience from Google. I have seen similar testimonials before here and there. I myself echo that from my experience. I then burst with lot of thoughts around tech interviews. I have been on both sides of interviews and I have done decent amount of interviews on each side. It maybe worth putting down a few points.

Disclaimer - In the light of how things - all things - generally work, interview is broad topic. Below is a brief (read lazy) summary of whats on top of my mind on this subject. In particular, this is around tech interviews. More narrowly, it is around tech roles like SWE (Software Engineer), data engineers, data science, analyst, etc.

* methodologies

what questions to ask: Algorithmic questions  
what to evaluate: General Congnitive Ability  

There is a good number of tech companies following this methodology - using algorithmic coding questions during tech interviews. Suprisingly, this is not just for new grads, I have seen people with more than 10 years of experience been put into same process of doing this kind of CS fundamentals questions. The general motivation, I think and saw other people agree, is to enforce a standard high bar to ensure recruiting quality.  

A few implications of no standardized interview process:

1. Specific team has too much control, namely they get to decide what to ask and how they ask about it. Depends on the existing teams' people quality, new hires quality can fluctuate greatly. In addition, bad people can sneak in here and there.

2. Without an enforced standard hiring process, after a new executive gets on onboard, he/she/? can discretionarily bring onboard his previous connections without general consensus, which likely will make existing employees feel bad, which destroys the company's engineering brand, which destroys the company.

3. Interview is subjective. Without agreed process, given freedom, individual can get as creative as he/she/? can get, on assumption that interviewers are talented people, which is true in tech industry. Creative is good thing, but that good in judging people in hiring.

4. It cause people lost faith in company's engineering brand. Good expect company to only hiring good people, period.

* outcome

Given standardized interview process, a statistically good result will be achieved. That is to say, overall, companies will be able to hiring good people to do the work. It does not guarantee that it won't miss any good talent, or some of the exteme talents. Probably, it will miss out. But the point is that companies' intention is not to bruce forcefully find all good talents, and miss no single one. They just need a subset of them to do the work.
