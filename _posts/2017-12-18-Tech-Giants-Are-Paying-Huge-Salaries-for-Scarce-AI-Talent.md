>"As they chase this future, they are doling out salaries that are startling even in an industry that has never been shy about lavishing a fortune on its top talent."

One and the only message from the article is that: A.I. talents' demand outweighs supply, and techies are paying huge to fight for the scarce talents with specialties to tackle A.I. problems.<br/>
<br/>
This article first points out the trend: "Tech's biggest companies are placing huge bets on artificial intelligence", which unsurprisingly brings up the talents contest, and which ends up as salaries offering competition in most cases.<br/>
<br/>
It is mysterious that how much A.I. talents are being paid. This article unveils a range of $300,000 to $500,000 in salaries and company stocks based out of a group nine people who have worked for major tech companies or have received such offers from them. As pointe out, participants requested anonymity for their professional prospects, which serves as side evidence that how high compensations many other A.I. talents are being paied in the market will continue to be mysterious.<br/>
