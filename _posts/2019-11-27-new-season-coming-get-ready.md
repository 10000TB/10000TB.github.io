It is that time again in the year, skiing/snowboarding time! Tahoe ski resorts' opening days
are around the corner. Epic resorts like Heavenly is set to open on this Thursday, Kirkwood
and Northstar on Friday. I have not checked IKON resorts, but they likely open around the same
time or even earlier. Other resorts outside these two major passes are also opening. I have heard
 [Mammoth mountain](https://www.mammothmountain.com/) has been open for business for weeks for 2019/20
season.

I have some uncertainties around where I will be in the next few months, most likely east coast.
But the excitement is real, I cant stop checking status of resorts and virtually planning I might go
to this resort on this coming day. Besides, ski buddies are also calling and asking me to join their
gang. To prepare for the new season, there are a lot to consider for an epic experience. It is worth
putting together a summary of what past experiences are like for each resort, and what new updates each
resort has to offer for the new season. Besides, other logistics like housing options, transportatio,
weather, traffic, etc are unneglectable, especially when you are planning for a large group of people.





Gear up, see you on the slopes
