When I was on the loo today at work, some printed material installed on the side stall brings up
an interesting problem - planning fallacy, simply, people tend to overestimate how much time is
needed for a project. I find the material very interesting & useful, but sadly nothing I can share
on the material. I then went on to read more on the theory on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy">planning fallacy</a>, and here
is what I learnt and some of my previous experiences that echos to the theory.
