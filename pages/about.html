<Strong>Some facts about me</Strong>:
<br/>
‣ I received my bachelor of science degree(computer science) from <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a> Dec 2016. Go Rams.<br/>
‣ I jumped from 110th floor of a building once.<br/>
‣ 4 years old League of Legends player (as of 2018). <br/>
‣ In case it is hard for you pronounce my chinese name, remeber my fallback name is: David (My chinese name prounces: SHOO-how HOO). <br/>
‣ The most frequent edittor command I use on a daily basis is `:w` in vim - I find it annoying, and hope there is an auto-save soon. <br>

<Strong>Some quotes that I find interesting</Strong>
<br/>
‣ "When you are curious, you'll find a lot of interesting things to do".<br/>

‣ "For an engineer, learning doesn't stop after graduation/entering career, but rather learning for a professional engineer starts after he enters his professional career." <br/>

‣ "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened" <br/>
