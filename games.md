The reason, and the only reason, or the only reason needed for having this page is: I love playing games. In addition, I have may engineer friends who also love playing games, and I haven't found a good place from friends' blogs that writes about games. With those considerations, I decided to have this page to write about my gaming experience and potentially recommend some new games I have heard or tried. Cheers.
