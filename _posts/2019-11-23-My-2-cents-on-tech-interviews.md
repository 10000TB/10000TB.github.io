I came across an article of a candidate's experience with interviewing with Google. The impression I got from his words is that he's got great experience and he will still feel happy and lucky to have interviewed with google even he got rejected eventually.

His experience sheds light on the general positive recruiting experience from Google. I have seen similar testimonials before here and there. I myself echo that from my experience. I then burst with lot of thoughts around tech interviews. I have been on both sides of interviews and I have done decent amount of interviews on each side. It maybe worth putting down a few points.

>Disclaimer - In the light of how things - all things - generally work, interview is broad topic. Below is a brief (read lazy) summary of whats on top of my mind on this subject. In particular, this is around tech interviews. More narrowly, it is around tech roles like SWE (Software Engineer), data engineers, data science, analyst, etc.

## methodologies

what questions to ask: Algorithmic questions  
what to evaluate: General Congnitive Ability  

There is a good number of tech companies following this methodology - using algorithmic coding questions during tech interviews. Suprisingly, this is not just for new grads, I have seen people with more than 10 years of experience been put into same process of doing this kind of CS fundamentals questions. The general motivation, I think and saw other people agree, is to enforce a standard high bar to ensure recruiting quality.  

A few implications of no standardized interview process:

1. Specific team has too much control, namely they get to decide what to ask and how they ask about it. Depends on the existing teams' people quality, new hires quality can fluctuate greatly. In addition, bad people can sneak in here and there.

2. Without an enforced standard hiring process, after a new executive gets on onboard, he/she/? can discretionarily bring onboard his previous connections without general consensus, which likely will make existing employees feel bad, which destroys the company's engineering brand, which destroys the company.

3. Interview is subjective. Without agreed process, given freedom, individual can get as creative as he/she/? can get, on assumption that interviewers are talented people, which is true in tech industry. Creative is good thing, but that good in judging people in hiring.

4. It cause people lost faith in company's engineering brand. Good expect company to only hiring good people, period.

## outcome

Given standardized interview process, a statistically good result will be achieved. That is to say, overall, companies will be able to hiring good people to do the work. It does not guarantee that it won't miss any good talent, or some of the exteme talents. Probably, it will miss out. But the point is that companies' intention is not to bruce forcefully find all good talents, and miss no single one. They just need a subset of them to do the work.

This kind of interview ends up explicitly asking people to prepare / brush up their CS foundementals before interview. In some sense, the interview also measures how hard a person want to join the company of interest.

## candidate experience

My impression is that different companies have different strategies on tech recruiting and often drastically different interview process. That often comes down to different experience to each individual candidate.

I have heard, and quote:

1. "Amazon hiring is chaotic; Your life will be miserable; You will overwork; But their stocks have hugh growth"

2. "Facebook pays more; They move fast; They promote faster; FB is catching up Google"

3. "I want to work for Google; Google is great; Growth maybe slow"

For each individual company, in the past few years, I have seen they update their hiring specifics from time to time. Thereforce, one time quotes like above may not reflect what their hiring experience is really like. But in general, the overall interviewing experience rarely change much, and is quite persistent form what I can see.

IMO, each individual interview affects the overall candidate experience. How interviewers apprach candidates, how candidates feel they are treated by the interviewers, how kind is interviewers, how organized is the process, is the interviewer cool ? ...

## tips

My experience tells me that you will likely succeed in those interviews if you:

### Technical competence  

(Coding part)
* You are VERY familiar with CS fundamentals - well-known algorithms, frequently used data structures.
* Close to bug-free coding ability on shared online coding platform & whiteboard.

To achieve those, I have seen different people approach it differently. Some praticed solving a lot - I mean a lot - of those algorithmic problems. Some other comes with phD background, and are very good at them in general, and they simply pratice small amount of such problems for keep their "手感". I have also seen people spend thousands of dollars to take those 3rd party algorithm classes designed specifically for tech interviews.

(Design part)
* Speak what you know - Preferably, you can drive the process, persuade people with solid points, bring a consensus on to the table.

Design often comes with various depths. Those who have worked in their field for a long time naturally and easily can nail this part. Candidates with less experience, at least from what I have seen, are less likely to be asked same questions. Interviewer/companies can easily fail you if they want to. Typically, when you are interviewing for the position that is appropriate per your experience, appropriate problems are used to assess all candidates in the pipeline. I don't believe all
companies follow this though, which is likely true, especially in start-ups where processes can get messy sometimes.

### Communication  

(During interview)
* You don't need to please interviewers. Preferably, you stand your ground and proactively clarify it when there is a miscommunication.
* You know what you are talking about. Preferably, you are assertive and persuasive.
* You can comfortablely make a point. Preferably, you are articulate when you get across your point.
* You are not wordy. Preferably, you talk just right amount of time during each interaction, no more, no less, just right amount.
* You don't have to be humorous. But, if you can crack a joke, pls do so. Subconsciously, people favor and want to work with those that they like.
* You are not an asshole. Preferably, you don't argue everytime over anything just to prove yourself and your "I am smart" ass ego. Ideally, you are sympathetic, you listen carefully for what others have to say, and recognize the fact that you don't know sth when that is true.
* You communicate. Preferably, you drive the process, you ASK before jumping in.

### Experience

Interview at as many places as you can. Likely, you will fail quite a few of them when you are new to such interviews. After each interview, you can feel you subtly have a more mature view of interview process, and you can gradually identiy where you did well and where not. You will learn from them.

### Resources that maybe useful

There are a lot of resources online available. Many companies often send out their compiled preparation materials. Below is a list of resources that I have used and found helpful.

Algorithm coding  
* https://leetcode.com/ - You can filter problems by companies, problem type, data structures. Downside is that you need to pay for some of the features and problems. To give a sense my preparation - by the time I was interviewing with FB & Google, I finished ~600 problems overall (shamelessly posting my profile page here https://leetcode.com/10000tb/).  
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ - I mainly take references from this site. Be critical & cautious when you consume the content on this site, I find some content misleading. But overall, it has a lot of good and helpful code snippets.

Design
* Google it ?

In addition, there is a famous book called sth like "crack the technical interview". I heard many people mentioned it and there is good amount of good mentions online as well. It might also be worth checking out. But I have not read any bit of that book.

Good luck.
