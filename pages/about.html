<span style="width:80px;height:30px;background-color:rgba(0,49,107,0.6);color:white;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some quotes that I find interesting:&nbsp;&nbsp;</Strong></span><br/>
‣ "When you are curious, you'll find a lot of interesting things to do".<br/>

‣ "For an engineer, learning doesn't stop after graduation/entering career, but rather learning for a professional engineer starts after he enters his professional career." <br/>

‣ "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened" <br/>
