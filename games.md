The reason, and the only reason, or the only reason needed for having this page is: I love playing games. In addition, I have may engineer friends who also love playing games, and I haven't found a good place from friends' blogs that writes about games. With those considerations, I decided to have this page to write about my gaming experience and potentially recommend some new games I have heard or tried. Cheers.

I have listed games by section, and individual posts regarding each game will fall into their own sections respectively.

I started my Lol journey since 2014, very few months before I came to US. I have got addicted to this game for years now, and will continue to play it when I have time. Highly recommended !<br/>
