‣ Email is the best way to reach me.<br/>
‣ In general, I try to reply to as many emails as I can as long as it is from real people and for good cause.<br/>
‣ A short message will be helpful. A message taking more than 30 seconds to read is likely to be disregarded.<br/>
‣ Solicitations within following areas are more likely to be replied. Note that information security complaint will for sure be replied.<br/>
‣ Areas: 0) information security complaint. 1) connect for general discussion around tech. 2) entrepreneurship. 3) we know each other before, reconnect now. 4) ski. <br/>
‣ What for sure will be filtered/ignored: automated emails, 3rd party recruiter solicitations.

<span style="width:80px;height:30px;background-color:clear;color:black;">Some facts about me</Strong></span><br/>
‣ I received my bachelor of science degree (major in computer science & minor in math) from <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a> Dec 2016. Go Rams!<br/>
‣ I jumped from 110th floor of a building once.<br/>
‣ In case you find it hard to pronounce my chinese name (SHOO-how HOO), I go by David. <br/>
‣ The most frequent edittor command I use on a daily basis is `:w` in vim - I find it annoying, and hope there is an auto-save soon. <br>
‣ I once drove up south lake Tahoe, CA with a 2 wheel drive coupe, and got stuck in heavy snow for ~ 6 hours, and survived back to bay area luckily. <br/>
