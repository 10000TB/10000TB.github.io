To curate, to learn/think and to follow - `10000tb`  
  
There are many times when I saw interesting/inspiring/refreshing quotes and the excitement fades out shortly after I saw it and went away. It occurs to me that I might as well curate this list of quotes that I have seen and liked to capture those sources of excitement.  
> Suggestions of quotes warmly welcome.  
  
The list go from here, and I will make commentary notes as needed.

> Speak up, believe in yourself. Take risks  -  Sheryl Sandberg
  
> O lady! we receive but what we give and in our life alone does Nature live - Samuel Taylor Coleridge
  
> An ounce of heart knowledge is worth more than a ton of head learning - Charles H. Spurgeon  
  
> The first step of solving a problem is admitting there is a problem to be solved - Pete Seeger
  
> Beware of spitting against the wind! - Friedrich Nietzsche
