I came across an article of a candidate's experience with interviewing with Google. The impression I got from his words is that he's got great experience and he will still feel happy and lucky to have interviewed with google even he got rejected eventually.

His experience sheds light on the general positive recruiting experience from Google. I have seen similar testimonials before here and there. I myself echo that from my experience. I then burst with lot of thoughts around tech interviews. I have been on both sides of interviews and I have done decent amount of interviews on each side. It maybe worth putting down a few points.
