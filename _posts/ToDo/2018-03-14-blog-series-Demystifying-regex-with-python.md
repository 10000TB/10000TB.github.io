When you to extract a valid IP from a string, or when you have a string with a know pattern and want to separate it into a list, or when you have a string and you simply want to check if it falls into a pattern, how would you approach ?  
  
I bet there are tons of creative solutions out there for approaching each problem as mentioned above, but here I would like to share my thoughts and exploration on the beauty of using `re` regular expression module in python in solving problem as such.
