                    Language &nbsp;&nbsp;  <code>Swift</code>
                    <br/>
                    Get started &nbsp; &nbsp; <code> 7/10 - easy to use, simply construct a new instance and present the viewcontroller</code>
                    <br/>
                    Active Level &nbsp;&nbsp; <code>4/10 - No active or delayed respones for issues, and use with caution</code>
                    <br/>
                    Completeness &nbsp;&nbsp; <code>5/10 - Good quality overall, but performance is really bad</code>

                    <br/>
                    <pre>
Well-designed and implemented image edittor. Definitely worth a try, but performance is really bad.

PROS
Icons, transitions, existing filters, and editting capabilities are definitely somewhat close to production
grade on the suface. Definitely worth your try if you need an edittor quikly up and running - It is pretty 
easy to integrate. Simply initialize a new viewcontroller (w/ photos/images of interest in UIImage form) and 
present it modally.

CONS
The performance is really bad. Presenting the edittor viewcontroller can takes seconds, and it crashes from 
time to time. New SDKS coming up, it is unknown if this edittor still works, and if the performance continues
to suck.

                    Get started &nbsp; &nbsp; <code> 5/10 - easy to use for people in the domain. But there is a steep learning curve for newbies. Dev and testing setups ideally need dedicated hardwares</code>
                    <br/>
                    Active Level &nbsp;&nbsp; <code>9/10 - There are very active maintainers behind it. There are active engineers from Google and Facebook useing it and maintaining it </code>
                    <br/>
                    Completeness &nbsp;&nbsp; <code>7/10 - There are obvious missing pieces (see issues list), but support for core use cases are there. As adoption spread over more places, more smaller pieces may get picked up and implemented</code>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <pre>
Userspace software and toolkit fully in golang - lightweight, fast, more debugging-friendly. there is active support from Google, and Facebook. Worth trying, be cautious that this project is under fast iterations and watch out for interfaces changes, behavior updates, etc.

See my post here for my experience with `uroot` - http://10000tb.org/engineering/a-brief-note-review-on-uroot.html
