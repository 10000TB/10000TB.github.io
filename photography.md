I used to not believe in capturing and sharing any personal moment, either to show to friends or post on social networks. I don't actually remember when but I have rapidly changed my mindset on sharing and social networking in a more open way. This page in this blog, as part of my social network existence, mainly serves as a place where I would like to share my Nonprofessional-photography work. To share some of my views of our world with visitors; cheers.
